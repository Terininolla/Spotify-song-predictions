Papa Was A Rolling Stone,1,Was (Not Was),"It was the third of September That day I'll always remember, yes I will 'Cause that was the day that my daddy died I never had a chance to see him Never heard nothin' but bad things about him Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth Mama looked up and said son Papa was a rolling stone Wherever he laid his hat was his home And when he died all he left us was alone Where the hell are you daddy, that's what I'm sayin' Down on my knees and tears and I'm prayin' Wishing and hoping my dreams could come true So I could feel like the other kids do A young child but not complete as a whole Before I was born you up and strolled Mama was there but you was up in the wind You never even knew my name and then You never wrote, called, let alone came by As a youth it was hard to wonder why But now I'm older and I don't dwell on self pity Thinking about the life you didn't give me I remember when I used to tell lies When people would ask I'd just fantasize Thinking of stories to make you look good But the real truth was you was never no good People would say I looked just like you But rest assured I don't act like you I'm more than that, my mama raised me better And you can best believe I'm much more together So belive that Mama is it true what they say That papa never worked a day in his life? And mama there's some bad talk goin' round town That papa had three out-side children And another wife, and that ain't right Heard some talk about papa Doin' some store-front prechin' Talking about saving souls and all the time leaching Dealin' in dirt and stealing in the name of the Lord Mama looked up and said son Papa was a rolling stone Wherever he laid his hat was his home And when he died all he left us was alone It's been said you gave me something you never had But that's not always true and it's sad To find myself missing you when I did But who knows the reasons why you did what you did I can't help but wonder why You lived your life as a big fat lie You act like you had no responsibilities 'Cause if you did it's a bet that you wouldn't be Stealin' beggin' hustlin' and schemin' You could'a got a job But did you know the meaning of work I'm talking about an honest day's pay But you was too lazy to be that way Always trying to take the easy route That's what they tell me, so I don't doubt It for a moment, not for a sec Because you lacked all your self respect But it's too late for you that is Tomorrow I'll be going on about my biz And so it's time to put the past behind Erase the anger and clear my mind I want to forget the little bit I know And make sure that I never sink so low 'Cause I want my kids to grow up and know That I was always there because I loved them so And that's the least thing that I can do But that's a lot more than I got from you I heard papa call himself a jack of all trades Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave? Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal To pay his bills Hey mama, folks say papa wasn't much on thinkin' Spent most of his time chasing women and drinkin' Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth Papa was a rolling stone Wherever he laid his hat was his home And when he died all he left us was alone",31,The Collection,0.821,0.79,10,-9.019,0,0.0645,0.0883,0.000218,0.0552,0.656,115.214,404733

I Need Love,1,LL Cool J,"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life, I see I need love There I was giggling about the games That I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn As I said to myself, ""look what you've done to her"" I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal Playing make-believe pretending that I'm true Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you Saying amor kissing you on the ear Whispering, ""I love you and I'll always be here"" Although I often reminsce I can't believe that I found A desire for true love floating around Inside my soul because my soul is cold One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old But the other half needs affection and joy And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy I need love I need love Romance, sheer delight, how sweet? I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat Kiss you on the cheek and say, ""ooh girl, you're so sweet"" It's deja vu whenever I'm with you I could go on forever telling you what I do But where you at? You're neither here or there I swear I can't find you anywhere Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug This love search is really making me bug And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen? Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean Fantasies can run, but they can't hide And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside I need love I need love I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you Grind, moan and never be alone If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad I've got money, but love's something I've never had I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet I swear to you this is something I'll never forget I need love I need love See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration This whole experience has been such a revelation It's taught me love and how to be a real man To always be considerate and do all I can Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much My body tingles all over from the slightest touch Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive I'll search the whole world for that special girl When I finally find you watch our love unfurl I need love I need love Girl, listen to me.

The Pretender,2,Jackson Browne,"I'm going to rent myself a house In the shade of the freeway I'm going to pack my lunch in the morning And go to work each day And when the evening rolls around I'll go on home and lay my body down And when the morning light Comes streaming in I'll get up and do it again Amen Say it again Amen I want to know what became of the changes We waited for love to bring Were they only the fitful dreams Of some greater awakening? I've been aware of the time going by They say in the end it's the wink of an eye And when the morning light Comes streaming in You'll get up and do it again Amen Caught between the longing for love And the struggle for the legal tender Where the sirens sing And the church bells ring And the junk man pounds his fender Where the veterans dream of the fight Fast asleep at the traffic light And the children solemnly wait For the ice cream vendor Out into the cool of the evening Strolls the Pretender He knows that all his hopes and dreams Begin and end there Ah the laughter of the lovers As they run through the night Leaving nothing for the others But to choose off and fight And tear at the world with all their might While the ships bearing their dreams Sail out of sight I'm going to find myself a girl Who can show me what laughter means And we'll fill in the missing colors In each other's paint-by-number dreams And then we'll put our dark glasses on And we'll make love until our strength is gone And when the morning light Comes streaming in We'll get up and do it again Get it up again I'm gonna be a happy idiot And struggle for the legal tender Where the ads take aim and lay their claim To the heart and the soul of the spender And believe in whatever may lie In those things that money can buy Though true love could have been a contender Are you there?
